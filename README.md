# NKBIPS - Nostr Knowledge Base Implementation Possibilities

*Suggestions Welcomed*
## Outline of purpose
- Have many individual micro-verses of content
- Atomic units of knowledge (index cards) are composable into full fledged articles
- Other users can take existing index cards and mix with other cards for new articles. Centralized knowledge bases, each with their own submission specifications can be aggregated into a client for users to navigate and explore

## Knowledge is interactive
- Users can comment on the full article or just a specific section
- Users without permissions to publish to a topical relay can still interact with content on their own publishable relays
- References to other notes or external content

## Knowledge is entangled
- Clarifying questions from readers
- Articles composed from multiple authors
- Multiple Perspectives per article or vocabulary definition

## Reference Client
- [indextr](https://github.com/limina1/indextr-client/blob/main/README.md)
- [Repository to upload existing notes](https://github.com/limina1/upload_files/tree/main)
